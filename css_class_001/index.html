      In 2015, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
      Organization (UNESCO) declared 28 September as the International Day for
      Universal Access to Information (IDUAI). This year, the day will be
      observed with the theme: "Mainstreaming Access to Information and
      Participation in the Public Sector." Access to information is a
      fundamental human right that ensures accountability and transparency,
      especially within government systems. It empowers individuals to make
      informed decisions, enhances public trust, and promotes social progress.
      Various terms such as Access to Information (ATI), Right to Information
      (RTI), Right to Know (RTK), and Freedom of Information (FOI) are used
      interchangeably to describe this right. However, regardless of
      terminology, access to information is globally recognised as an important
      element of freedom of expression, enshrined in Article 19 of both the
      Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on
      Civil and Political Rights. At least 125 countries, including Bangladesh,
      have enacted national laws to operationalise this right. Bangladesh
      introduced the Right to Information Act, 2009 (RTI Act) to ensure citizens
      can access public information. The Global Right to Information Rating
      (GRTI) has assessed Bangladesh's RTI Act as a "reasonably good law,"
      noting that it reflects a strong approach to access to information.
      However, the GRTI also highlighted concerns over the blanket exceptions
      for police, security, and intelligence services, which hinder full
      transparency.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Although the Constitution of Bangladesh does not explicitly guarantee the
      right to information, the RTI Act is rooted in the constitutionally
      recognised fundamental rights to freedom of thought, conscience, and
      speech <span>under Article 39</span>. This article provides for the right to freedom of
      expression, though it also allows for "reasonable restrictions" in the
      interest of national security, public order, and morality. These
      restrictions are mirrored in the RTI Act, where certain types of
      information are exempt from disclosure, a provision that GRTI deems
      problematic.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Despite these exceptions, the RTI Act is relevant in Bangladesh's evolving
      political landscape, especially for <strong>promoting transparency</strong> and
      accountability.

      Citizens can request a broad range of documents and materials, including
      reports, memos, data, contracts, maps, and audio-visual materials related
      to the activities of any authority. However, note sheets or copies of note
      sheets, often used in internal decision-making processes, cannot be
      requested as per Section 2(f). Section 7 of the act outlines exemptions to
      protect national security, foreign relations, commercial secrets, and
      intellectual property. Information that could harm third-party interests,
      obstruct law enforcement, or interfere with judicial proceedings is also
      protected. Other sensitive information, including tax details, financial
      policies, personal privacy, and matters pending in court, cannot be
      disclosed. Additionally, strategic or commercially sensitive technical
      data and Cabinet discussions are exempt unless the Information Commission
      (IC) permits disclosure.
